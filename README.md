# PHP MySQL Blog Examples

This repository contains examples of a simple blog implemented in pure PHP. The examples are divided into two folders: `ex1` and `ex2`.

## Folders

### ex1
This folder contains a basic implementation of a blog using pure PHP. The focus is on demonstrating how to create a blog without using any frameworks or advanced programming techniques.

### ex2
This folder contains a more advanced implementation of the blog using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in PHP. This example provides a more structured and modular approach to building a PHP application.

## Note
The examples provided in this repository are for educational purposes only and are not complete implementations of a blog. They are intended to demonstrate different approaches to building a PHP application.

## Getting Started
To get started with these examples, you can clone the repository and explore the code in the `ex1` and `ex2` folders.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DanioFiore/php-mysql-blog.git
